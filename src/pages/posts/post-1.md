# My first blog post
Publish date: 2024-10-16

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished
1. **Installed Astro**: I started by installing Astro using the command line.
2. **Created my first post**: I then created my first blog post inside `/src/pages/posts/`.
3. **Customized my template**: I then customized my template to show the currenly date.

## What's next
I'll finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
